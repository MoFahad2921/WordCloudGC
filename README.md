# WordCloudGC
Creating a Word Cloud and Sentiment Analyzer from YouTube comment data using Python.

#Note

- This was a pretty fun project for me to learn
- I used comment data from the song Baby Blue |Bad Finger Breaking Bad edition.
- A very neat trick to keep track of your social media analytics.
- Ensure that you keep in mind the terms of service of the YouTube API when using this script. Also, to avoid hitting any limits do not cross the quotas.
